UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD
THE TRILOGY

2
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,440
PART ONE

3
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,520
Pietro,
You should be in bed.

4
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,751
I don't sleep anymore, doctor.
Speeping is "out".

5
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,234
- Shit!
- Yes...

6
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,471
- She didn't see us, Raymond.
- I'm sorry, we were not introduced.

7
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,397
- Claire Tourneur.
- I am Raymond, He's Chico.

8
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,874
Chico, you could apologize to...
Madame Tourneur.

9
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,075
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

10
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,756
I'm sorry, I've been an idiot.

11
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,192
I'm sorry.

12
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,358
Will your car still work?

13
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,600
People always want to give definitions.
You say "Rock'n Roll"

14
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,114
they ask, "Which kind?".

15
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,996
But I just play rock'n roll.
I'm a drummer.

16
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,160
- Did you hear him playing?
- He's been breaking my head
for 15 years.

17
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,790
Raymond is the same. When he says
he is buddhist, people go crazy.

18
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,600
- They can't stand him!
- It's not the same.

19
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,480
There's nothing wrong in
being buddhist.

20
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,950
- In his job, yes.
- What's his job?

21
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,479
My job is...
fuck and fucking.

22
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,757
- I want a beer.
- For a change!

23
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,276
We might stop there.

24
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,276
Leave it there!

25
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,792
Don't touch it!

26
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,479
- Who's there?
- It's me.

27
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,635
I've got to talk with you.

28
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,398
Your bag's heavy.

29
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,631
- This is enough for being rich.
- You might pay a coffee in Rome.

30
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,280
Did you see well? It's 50,000!

31
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,757
What did I say?
It's the price for a cappuccino.

32
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,872
But with this one you could
buy half a cow in Ethiopia.

33
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,716
- Have you been there?
- Yes.

34
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,071
- Where else have you been?
- More or less everywhere.

35
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,800
I've never been anywhere.
I don't care.

36
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,954
- Well actually I've been in America.
- So, how much do you have there?

37
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,112
Count them, I leave it here.
Sleep on it.

38
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,159
Perfect!

39
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,360
I don't trust people
who do thing for free.

40
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,238
- And you'd be a buddhist?
- Realist!

41
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,595
So?

42
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,871
I agree, for 30%.

43
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,236
- We counted the money, we can find you.
- Calm down Raymond.

44
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,480
If you want to change your mind....
Do as you want.

45
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,240
If the address is not real,
we know where to find you.

46
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,435
It's not worth to try to fool us.

47
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,680
We don't know who will fetch the money.

48
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,320
If it's not me, and if
you want to contact me,

49
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,676
have a drink, listen to some music...

50
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,638
Yes! You never know.

51
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,359
This is my music.
It's just a demo.

52
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,478
Thanks, Chico.

53
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,915
- Don't lose time.
- Don't worry.

54
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,399
Here she is!

55
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,720
Where is she now ?

56
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,713
She should be between St. Etienne...

57
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,074
- and Lyon.
- still a long road.

58
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,314
- 15 more minutes?
- At least. Still has to dry up.

59
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,752
- You were lucky, and had good tyres.
- Hurry up!

60
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,758
Eugene speaking,

61
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,560
but I'm not here...

62
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,437
me neither.

63
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,040
Wait, I have to remove the foam.

64
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,960
- Will it hold til Paris?
- Yes, no problems.

65
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,430
But you're going to draw
people's attention with that foam.

66
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,992
I'm Trevor McPhee.
You saved my life.

67
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,392
Oh, it's you, Claire!

68
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,716
So you smoke now?

69
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,919
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

70
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,715
Who is she? What is she doing here?

71
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,398
Uncle Anton, I have to...

72
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,438
On the contrary.

73
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,040
Are you escaping from the police?

74
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,071
Where is he from?

75
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,032
And you're... in honeymoon?

76
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,638
Excuse me.

77
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,239
Excuse me.

78
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,716
Charly Yu.

79
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,912
OK.

80
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,840
It's for men!

81
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,399
- That way.
- Thank you!

82
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,476
- Miss! Wait!
- A foreigner?

83
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,836
There is a foreign woman.

84
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:26,800
Madam, are you sure you're not wrong?
This place is for men only!

85
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,555
It's no place for women here!
Only for men, forbidden to women.

86
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:37,319
Ehi, beautiful!

87
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,996
I need help.

88
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,600
- Winter ! No !
- Escape, run !

89
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:57,160
END OF PART ONE

90
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:59,230
UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD
